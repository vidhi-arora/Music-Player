# Music-Player 

We were given a Major Project in college in second year under the Web Development Course. We had to prepare 2 screens of a music player 
i.e. a home screen and a single playlist screen using only HTML and CSS, no JS or BOOTSTRAP was allowed.

This is my attempt to design screens of a Music Player (using only HTML AND CSS)
