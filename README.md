# Music-Player 

We were given a Major Project in college in second year under the Web Development Course in which we had to prepare 2 screens of a music player-
i.e. a home screen and a single playlist screen using only HTML and CSS, no JS or BOOTSTRAP was allowed and had to make the design responsive as well.

So this is my Music Player Project (using only HTML AND CSS)
